# Demonstrating the Use of Structures in C

## Aim

To define and manipulate structured data types in C programming.

----------

## Example Problems

### Example 1: Representing a Book Record

**Problem Statement:** Define a structure to represent a book with attributes such as ID, title, rating, and price. Write a program to input and display the details of a book. Take input from user to search a book by ID.

**Algorithm:**

1.  Start the program.
2.  Define a structure named `Book` with fields for ID, title, rating, and price.
3.  Declare an array of type `Book`.
4.  Input values for the structure fields.
5.  Print the details of the book.
6. Input the ID value to search in the array.
7. Loop over the array to search for the ID.
8.  End the program.


### Example 2: Array of Structures for Student Records

**Problem Statement:** Create an array of structures to store details of multiple students, including their name, roll number, and marks. Implement functionality to display the records.

**Algorithm:**

1.  Start the program.
2.  Define a structure named `Student` with fields for name, roll number, and marks.
3.  Declare an array of type `Student`.
4.  Input values for the structure fields using a loop.
5.  Display the details of all students.
6.  End the program.

## Suggested Programs (Any 1)

### 1. Searching an Employee Record

**Problem Statement:** Define a structure to represent an employee with attributes like name, ID, and salary. Write a program to input and search for employee details by ID.

----------

### 2. Array of Structures for Product Inventory

**Problem Statement:** Create an array of structures to store details of products, including name, ID, and price. Implement functionality to search for a product by ID.

----------

### 3. Nested Structures for Address Book

**Problem Statement:** Define a structure `Address` with fields for city and pincode. Nest it within another structure `Person` that contains name and phone number. Write a program to input and search for persons by name.

----------

### 4. Searching an Array of Structures for Students

**Problem Statement:** Define a structure `Student` with fields for name, roll number, and marks. Create an array of structures and implement a functionality to search for students by roll number.
